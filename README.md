# Algobot

Hi. Is crippling depression and low self confidence making you anxious as placement season is approaching? Do you think you need some external motivation to amp you up to start solving millions of competitive coding questions available out there? Well practice makes perfect and, it's never too late.

AlgoBot is a discord bot that send you coding questions from well established online coding platforms(just leetcode for now) on to your servers, whenever you need it and helps you build a competitive platform among your peers. This would help yourself get motivated to solve questions and have fun while doing it. I know competitive coding might get boring but here's something that might make your experience a little bit better. Goodluck on those interviews.
